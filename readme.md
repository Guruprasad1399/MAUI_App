# Bluetooth Connectivity App in .NET MAUI for Windows Application (Prototype Project for Interview)

## Overview
This project is a prototype of a .NET MAUI application designed just to showcase the ability of MAUI in developing a Windows app to use Bluetooth connectivity. It's an example of leveraging .NET MAUI's networking capabilities to detect and respond to changes in Bluetooth connection status. It is also designed to solve the challenge that react native poses for Windows App.

## Features
- Monitors network connectivity.
